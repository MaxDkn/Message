# College Messaging System

Welcome to the College Messaging System project! This project was created during my college years and allows users to exchange messages using shared files on a local network. The messaging system operates through the command line interface.

## Getting Started

1. To run the system, execute the `main.py` script.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. No external requirements are needed. The system relies on shared folders for communication.

3. To implement the system on your local network, modify the 4th line in `main.py` and set the desired shared folder location.

## Usage

- The system operates through a command line interface.
- Shared folders serve as the medium for sending and receiving messages.
- Messages are exchanged by updating files within the shared directory.

## Project Overview

- The project was developed during college to facilitate online communication using a local network.
- No external dependencies are required to run the system.
- Messages are stored in shared files within a specified directory.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script to initiate the messaging system.
2. Update the shared folder location in `main.py` to configure the network settings.
3. Communicate with others by updating shared files within the specified directory.

## Notes

- This project was implemented without external dependencies, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.
- Feel free to customize and extend the system based on your requirements.

Thank you for exploring the College Messaging System!
